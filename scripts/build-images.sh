# Builds this project's image HERE (a development machine) and packs it into a

# For this project that matters more than for a backend-only app: the build
# stage installs the whole frontend toolchain from npm. On a filtered or
# throttled connection that is the slowest part of a deploy, or fails outright.
# Building here and shipping the result sidesteps it.
